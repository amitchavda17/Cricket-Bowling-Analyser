# Cricket-Bowling-Analyser


Cricket Bolwing analyser is  a low cost embedded system  that can be used for analysing bolwers perfromance analysis in Cricket.The system is capable of measuring line length and speed of delivery.
The system consist of an  sensor matrix integrated with embedded system for measuring line and length of delivery and uses ultrasonic sensor for measuring the speed of dleivery.
A basic GUI is designed for  providing performance  analysis to user.
